				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<img width="250px" src="../assets/images/avery.jpg" 
				style="float: left"/> <!-- I fixed the source path for your image. You want to add the .. in front of the forward slash so that the processor knows to go out one directory so it can find the assets folder where the images are stored. This is just like the command line where you use cd .. to go up one directory. Also, make sure that you aren't using inline styles, put all styles in your style sheet! -->
				<p>
					I was born in Newport Beach California the summer of 1985. I had a typical middle class upbringing going camping and hiking the weekends I wasn't playing soccer or basketball. 
				</p>
				<p>
					During my tween years I dropped all organized sports and picked up a skateboard. I spent many weekends throwing myself down stairs, running from cops and jumping fences. Probably not the best way to spend my teenage years, but skateboarding provided a very inovative way for me to express my creativity and conect with my enviornment in an entirely new way. There are no rules with skateboarding, you do a trick going forwards, backwards, on a rail, on a ledge, down stairs, up stairs, anything within reason could go from a simple thought to a reality. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunatly my dreams of being a professional skateboarder faded with a broken ankle and I soon enrolled in aviation school. Upon graduating with a Airframe and Powerplant certificate I decided to join the Marine Corps spending 4 years as a hydraulic/pneumatic/structures mechanic, expanding my knowledge of aviation to include all facets of mechanics.    
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite a dibilitating left shoulder injury suffered while riding a motorcycle, I pursued a very active lifestyle during and after the Marine Corps that took me from the inhosbitable climate of the Himalayas to the beautiful Hawaiian islands scuba diving with whale sharks. Now on to the biggest challenge of all, learning html and css.
